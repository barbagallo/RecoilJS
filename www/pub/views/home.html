    <h1>Why should I use RecoilJS?</h1>
    <p>The most important feature of RecoilJS is the architecture:  Recoil was architected in such a way that it will not limit you as a developer.  It provides a series of tools that you can use; however, it is totally up to you how much or how little you use.</p>
    <p>Some other features:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Two-way data-binding</dt>
      <dd>Data-binding is a way for you to link your DOM elements to your data.  This eliminates the hassle of manually syncing your UI and data.</dd>

      <dt>Templating</dt>
      <dd>Recoil provides an easy templating syntax that gives you access to dynamic features such as logical blocks, iteration, and of course, text replacement.  More importantly, these templates will intelligently re-render individual parts as your data changes.</dd>
      
      <dt>Composition</dt>
      <dd>Composition gives you a way to load in components as controller/view pairs.  This is particularly useful for loading modules, or sections of your site.  Of course, you can also load in standalone views, or choose a view and controller to load in together.</dd>

      <dt>Routing</dt>
      <dd>Recoil provides a simple router that lets you easily handle all hash changes to provide linkable URL's within single-page applications.</dd>
